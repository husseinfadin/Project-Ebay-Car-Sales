We've made a few modifications from the original dataset:

We sampled 50,000 data points from the full dataset, to ensure your code runs quickly in our hosted environment
We dirtied the dataset a bit to more closely resemble what you would expect from a scraped dataset (the version uploaded to Kaggle was cleaned to be easier to work with)
